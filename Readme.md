# Optimus_Bhupender_Capstone_CareerGrab

## Project Idea
CareerGrab is a web application that allows employers to post jobs and job seekers to search and apply for them. It provides a streamlined experience for job seekers to find opportunities and for employers to manage job postings. The application includes authentication (both email/password and Google OAuth), file upload for resumes, and CRUD functionality for managing job listings. It will be built using ReactJS/Vite, NodeJS, and MongoDB.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS/Vite
- Backend: NodeJS, ExpressJS
- Database: MongoDB
- Auth: JWT & Google OAuth
- Hosting: Netlify/Vercel (frontend), Railway/Render (backend)
